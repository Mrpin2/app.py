st.markdown("""
- **Content Stream Compression (Lossless):** Applies zlib compression to text, vector graphics, and other content streams within the PDF. This doesn't lose any detail.
- **Image Quality (Lossy):** Re-compresses images within the PDF to a lower quality (like a lower quality JPEG). This can significantly reduce file size but will make images less sharp.
- **Object Optimization:** Removes duplicate objects and unused data within the PDF structure.
